# 01. Preparing environments
## Jupyter Lab:
How to install: see [README](guides/README.md).

At the end of the above file, there are also instructions for how to install and run from command line (no Jupyter Lab) at HPC2N. 

## Google Colab: 
See [Howto_GoogleColab](guides/Howto_GoogleColab.md).

# 02. Datasets:
We mostly will work with:
- The MNIST dataset for image processing 
- The IMDB reviews for NLP tasks.

# 03. Labs:
- Tensorflow and Tensorboard: basics
- Tensorflow: Linear Regression with constraints during optimization.
- RNN: Language Modelling task.
- Transformers: sentiment classification tasks.
- ETNLP: Exploring different word embeddings.
- ELMO and BERT: sentiment classification tasks.
- GANs: Generative Adversarial Networks
